# Cleaning-Bird-Strikes-Data

This assignment was a part of curriculum for the course: Collect/Store/Retrieve data.

The task was to clean up the messy bird-strikes data. It required date parsing, string parsing and other cleaning methods to manipulate data and get it in the desired form. So this code is demonstration of intensive data cleaning that I performed in R.

One difficult challenge was to shape the data, parse dates of all different formats and convert to name of month. Then categorize as which season it belongs to - Spring, Summer, Fall and Winter.

Later I was appointed as the Teaching Assistant for this course where I taught useful concepts to students such as data scrapping, cleaning, manipulation, visualization and machine learning.
